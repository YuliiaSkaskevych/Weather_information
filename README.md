HOMEWORK #24

Here is the list open https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#weather (you can choose any level)

it is necessary to implement functions for at least 3 APIs in one category. all code is sent asynchronously.

(by functions for each api, since the answer may be different)

The task is to get data from several sources, convert it to the appropriate format, compare and get the best option.

For example, if it is the weather, then after the query you will get the temperature for tomorrow, after which you will calculate the average value as the most probable.

For example, if it's finance, you'll get rates that are comparable and return only the highest.

You can use any other API that suits you.

I'm waiting for your code in the form of a link to a repository or file. preferably a screen output of the program.

The hindsight of storing keys in repositories is very, very bad.
